Spam Master implements a new concept called High Availability Firewall that protects your website against dangerous exploits like HTTP and HTTPS DDoS (denial-of-service), SQL injections, brute force attacks and many others threats.

= Spam Buffer =

Buffer technology greatly reduces server resources like cpu, memory and bandwidth by doing fast local machine checks. Also prevents major attacks like flooding, DoS , etc. via Spam Master Firewall.

= Whitelist Exemptions =

Spam Buffer Whitelisting excludes spam checks from safe Emails or Ip's, it also removes these safe Emails and Ip's from your local Spam Buffer.

= No more Annoying CAPTCHA =

Spam Master stops spam bots without user annoying CAPTCHA, reCaptcha, counts, puzzles and or any other question answer system. It improves your visitors satisfaction and browsing experience stopping spam bots at the same time.
